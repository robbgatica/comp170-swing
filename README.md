# Example Java Projects - Swing GUI

## Getting Started with Swing Components

---

Similar to SWT, Swing is a Java framework that allows you to create window-based GUI's and is built upon the AWT packages.  However, a huge benefit of Swing is that you don't have to do any additional configuration to add its components into your programs (unlike SWT or JavaFX). You can get going with a simple `import` statement at the beginning of your class file.  

Below you'll find a handful of examples and brief walk-throughs which will hopefully help you get a feel for working with Swing.
