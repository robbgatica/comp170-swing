# Example Java Projects - Swing GUI

## Getting Started with Swing Components

---

Similar to SWT, Swing is a Java framework that allows you to create window-based GUI's and is built upon the AWT packages.  However, a huge benefit of Swing is that you don't have to do any additional configuration to add its components into your programs (unlike SWT or JavaFX). You can get going with a simple `import` statement at the beginning of your class file.  

Below you'll find a handful of examples and brief walk-throughs which will hopefully help you get a feel for working with Swing.

## Example 1 - Hello World

To get started, we'll work with 3 of the most fundamental components of Swing: **JFrame** (windows/shells), **JPanel** (containers that hold components), and **JLabel** (text or graphics).  The end result will be a simple window that displays the text "Hello World!".  You can follow along with the source code [here](https://github.com/robbgatica/comp170-swing/blob/master/src/swing/comp170/FrameDemo.java).
